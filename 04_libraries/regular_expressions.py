?               exactly one or none occurance of character is place after
\w              alphabets, numbers, and underscore
\d              digits from 0 to 9. One occurance. For multiple, use it repeatedly
\s              blank space
\b              boundary values
{number}        specify the number of character occurance it is placed after
[characters]    specify list of characters to find, any occurance
(groups)        specify the groups of characters
|               OR
